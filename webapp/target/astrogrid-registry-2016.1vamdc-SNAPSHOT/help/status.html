        <h1>Status of a registry entry</h1>

        <p>
          An entry is in one or three states:
        </p>
        <dl>
          <dt>active</dt>
          <dd>The entry is current and the registered resource is available.
            Put your entry in this state when you are ready for people to
            read it.</dd>
          <dt>inactive</dt>
          <dd>The registered resource is unavailable, or its registry entry
              is not yet complete (see below). Put your entry in this state 
              while you are adding information, or if your resource is off-line 
              for some lengthy period (greater than a week, say).
          <dt>deleted</dt>
          <dd>The registered resource is permanently gone. The registry entry
              is retained as a record.</dd>
        </dl>
        
        <p>
          All entries in this registry are created in the <i>inactive</i> state.
          This avoids them being shown to users before you complete the information.
          <strong>You must change the state to <i>active</i> when you want your
          entry to be visible to users.
        </p>
