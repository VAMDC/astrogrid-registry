        <h1>Core metadata: publisher</h1>

        <p>
          The <em>publisher</em> of a resource is the person or organization
          who put the resource on-line. It does not refer to the original
          creator of the resource (c.f. 
          <a href="creator.html"><em>creator</em></a> in the core metadata).
        </p>
        <p>
          It is usually more helpful to nominate an organization as publisher
          rather than an individual with an organization; organizations are
          more permanent. You can nominate a contact person within the
          organization separately (see the <em>contact</em> fields of
          the core metadata.
        </p>
        <p>
          The publisher name is free text, e.g. <em>CASU</em> or 
          <em>Cambridge Astronomical Survey Unit</em>. The publisher
          IVO identifier is a URI pointing to a separate registration of the
          publisher as an organization; e.g. <em>ivo://uk.ac.cam.ast/CASU</em>.
          The name is mandatory and the IVO identifier is optional. Note that the
          IVO identifier has to be a URI in the <em>ibo://</em> scheme; a URL
          in the <em>http://</em> pointing to a web-page is not correct.
        </p>
        <p>
          When you set up the registry the self-registration process may have
          created an organization registration for you.
