        <h1>Core metadata: content type</h1>

        <p>
          The <em>content type</em> of a registered resource is a keyword,
          taken from a fixed list, used for selecting resources from the
          registry.
        </p>
        <p>
          The list of allowed keywords has a rich and fine classification
          of resources from a librarian's point of view and relatively little
          that distinuishes functional parts of the virtual observatory. However, 
          the following technical meanings apply.
        </p>
        <dl>
          <dt>Catalog</dt>
          <dd>Use this for services that return tabular results: cone search,
              AstroGrid DSA, TAP etc. Use it also for registering data
              collections that contain only tables, especially TabularDB
              entries in AstroGrid.</dd>
          <dt>Registry</dt>
          <dd>This implies the self-registration of a registry. Don't use this
              in this interface for manual-entered resources; the registry
              itself enters these resources.</dd>
          <dt>Other</dt>
          <dd>The default setting. CEA applications (other than those associated
              with DSA services) <em>must have this type.</dd>
