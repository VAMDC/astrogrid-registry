        <h1>Core metadata: creator</h1>

        <p>
          The <em>creator</em> of a resource is the person or organization
          who generated the resource, rather than the party who puts the resource 
          on-line; c.f. <a href="publisher.html"><em>publisher</em></a> 
          in the core metadata. (The creator
          and the publisher might well be the same party.)
        </p>
        <p>
          It is usually more helpful to nominate an organization as creator
          rather than an individual with an organization; organizations are
          more permanent. However, individuals may be named if this gives
          credit more accurately.
        </p>
        <p>
          The creator name is free text, e.g. <em>CASU</em> or 
          <em>Cambridge Astronomical Survey Unit</em>. The creator
          IVO identifier is a URI pointing to a separate registration of the
          creator as an organization; e.g. <em>ivo://uk.ac.cam.ast/CASU</em>.
          The name is mandatory and the IVO identifier is optional. Note that the
          IVO identifier has to be a URI in the <em>ivo://</em> scheme; a URL
          in the <em>http://</em> pointing to a web-page is not correct.
        </p>
        <p>
          A URL to the creator's logo may also be published. This shows up
          as a "brand" in certain user interfaces.
