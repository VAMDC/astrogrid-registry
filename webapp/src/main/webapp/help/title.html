        <p>
          The title describes the registered resource as a whole. It is 
          typically used as a label in lists of similar resources. Therefore,
          it is best to pick a title that makes sense in a general context.
          <em>SDSS DR5 object catalogue</em> is better than 
          <em>SDSS catalogue</em> because it may appear in a list of several
          SDSS releases. <em>SDSS</em> alone fails to distinguish different
          kinds of VO resource (e.g. image and catalogue services) build from
          SDSS data. <em>Object catalogue</em> would be a very poor title; you
          cannot assume that the viewer knows from context the survey to which
          it applies.

        <p>
          Titles can be of any length, but long titles will cause problems when
          displayed in lists. Therefore, keep your title as short as possible;
          50 characters is a practical limit and 30 characters is better.
