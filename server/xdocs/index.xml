    	Registry server library is a library that provides the Registry Interface standards
    	set by the IVOA.  The library performs Inserts, Updates, Queries or OAI publishing information  of
    	Resources to the Registry.  The Registry tends to connect with an xmldb api to an XML database called
    	eXist.  See the webapp documentation of how to install the web application in a servlet container
    	such as Tomcat and begin using a Registry.
